# Project_Firefly
System Verilog code to create a mario-styled game, implemented with Intel DE_10 Lite FPGA board. The goal is to help the firefly run away from batman. You will need to collect fuels on the way and avoid touching any TNTs. The game is displayed on VGA port so you must have a VGA wire and a DE_10 Lite FPGA to run the program.
